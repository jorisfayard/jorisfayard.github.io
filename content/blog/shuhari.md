> **Shuhari (守破離)**
>
> Shuhari is a concept that describes the stages of learning to mastery in Japanese martial arts. It is sometimes applied to other disciplines, such as Go, tea ceremony, and even business practices.
>
> Shuhari roughly translates to "to keep, to fall, to break away" or "follow the rules, break the rules, transcend the rules".
>
> Here's a breakdown of the three stages:
>
> **1. Shu (守 - protect, obey)**
>
> *   In this initial stage, the student diligently follows the rules and teachings of their master or tradition.
> *   They focus on mastering the fundamentals, techniques, and forms without deviation.
> *   It's a period of repetition, discipline, and adherence to established wisdom.
>
> **2. Ha (破 - detach, digress)**
>
> *   In this stage, the student begins to break away from some of the traditional practices.
> *   They explore variations and exceptions to the rules, seeking to understand the underlying principles.
> *   They may also incorporate new techniques or knowledge from other sources.
> *   This is a stage of experimentation and innovation.
>
> **3. Ri (離 - leave, separate)**
>
> *   In this final stage, the student has fully mastered the art and transcends the need for rigid rules or forms.
> *   They operate with complete freedom and spontaneity, adapting their techniques to any situation.
> *   They may even create their own unique style or approach.
> *   This is a stage of mastery and self-discovery.

As you can realize from the explanation from Gemini, Shuhari is all about learning, questioning, exploring, merging, simplifying and continously growing. I think it's a good way to live a life.
