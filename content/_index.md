# My corner of the Internet

Hi, I'm Joris. I'm passionate about tech, martial arts, entrepreneurship, and self-improvement. This is where I'll share my raw and honest thoughts, hoping to both better understand myself and help others on their own journeys. I believe in continuous growth and learning, a philosophy embodied by the Japanese concept of Shuhariâ€”a path from mastering fundamentals to breaking the rules and ultimately transcending them. Join me as I explore this path.
